# talon-organteq
A powerful registration control system for Modartt's [Organteq 2](https://www.modartt.com/organteq_overview), built around a fully customizable rule-based grammar. Commands can be invoked either from a Python REPL session, by mapping them to switches on your MIDI controller, or with [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/) voice commands which allow hands-free control.

The provided voice command-mappings for optional use with Talon are documented [here](https://github.com/myersm0/talon-organteq/talon/README.md).

## Status: work in progress
A complete redesign of this repo is in progress. Use release v0.1 if you want something that works right now. Otherwise, I'm in the process of finalizing and documenting some big updates for a soon-to-come v0.2. Check back soon.
